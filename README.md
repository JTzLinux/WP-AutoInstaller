# WP-AutoInstaller

This script is just to make yourself the instalation way more easy because let's face it we are lazy ;)

## IMPORTANT!

Wordpress requires SQL! if you don't have SQL use the SQL Version of the scripts

## Windows - Without SQL

If you just want to install Wordpress because you already got SQL? Then just use: "Wordpress-Installer-Auto_NoSQL.bat" I always try to keep this script up to date

## Windows - With SQL

Currently there are not set password aka you can't set it yourself with this script but you can I will explain it to you how later

but anyway if you got no SQL use "Wordpress-Installer-Auto_WithSQL.bat" after you run it, it will do everything by itself *(mostly)* after the script is finished there should be a File on your Desktop called: Login.txt you require these for Login and for the Wordpress page

anyway after we ran it and finished it go to localhost (if you installed it locally on your computer) or else type in the Server URL in your browser
after you connected to your website choose your language and then enter the Information of the SQL Server (login.txt)

Use the Following:
```diff
-!!!DO NOT DELETE THE LOGIN.TXT AND KEEP IT IN A SAFE PLACE!!!
-!!!NEVER ENTER ROOT AND ROOTPASSWORD IN THERE!!!
```
```
Database Name = Database
Username = username
Password = userpassword
You can leave the rest
```
```diff
-!!!NEVER ENTER ROOT AND ROOTPASSWORD IN THERE!!!
```

If you want to make changes you can use your SQL Software (I use HeidiSQL) and login use the IP of the Server (or localhost if you run your SQL Software on the same Device) and use the rootpassword what was delivered with it (Login.txt) and then you can access it! but it is not necasary due to the Fact Wordpress does it for you ;)

## Linux?

Yes there will be a Linux version I am currently working on it

## MacOS?

Maybe I will do it but due to the fact nobody uses MacOS to host a server (atleast never heared of it) I will less prioritize it Sorry!
